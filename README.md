# GenMat

GenMat is a program for gene presence absence table generation for series of closely related bacterial genomes from annotated FASTA file. For genome annotation [prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka) could be used.

### Purpose

Initially the program was written as an alternative for [Roary](http://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/). It was used for the analysis of the bacterial isolates from the same source taken over time, thus the isolates were very closely related. The program performed well even with minor differences between samples and managed to identify them. 

### Requirements

Before running the program make sure that the following programs are installed and added to the path:
[BLAST >=2.6.0+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?CMD=Web&PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download)
[CD-HIT >=4.6.8](http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/)
